🔷 1. VxWorks BSP Structure for T2080

A Board Support Package (BSP) is essential to bring up VxWorks on a custom board using the T2080. Below is the recommended BSP folder and layer structure:

📁 Example Directory Structure:

t2080_vx7_bsp/
├── config/
│   ├── T2080_init.s        # Assembly init code
│   ├── config.h            # Board configuration macros
│   ├── sysLib.c            # Core board-specific logic
│   ├── hwconf.c            # I/O config (PCIe, Ethernet, UART)
│   └── romInit.s           # Bootrom start-up code
│
├── target/
│   ├── drv/                # Device drivers (Ethernet, UART, SRIO)
│   ├── mmu/                # Memory management support
│   └── vxWorks.st          # Symbol table
│
├── Makefile                # BSP build rules
└── vxWorksImage            # Final bootable image

📌 Key BSP Responsibilities:

Component	Function

T2080_init.s	Sets up MMU, caches, initial stack, TLB entries
romInit.s	Performs board reset sequence and prepares VxWorks boot
sysLib.c	Handles RAM size detection, peripheral access, T2080-specific init
hwconf.c	PCIe root complex init, Ethernet PHY config, interrupt setup
config.h	Configures features (e.g., SRIO_ENABLE, SEC_ENABLE)
Device drivers	TSEC/DTSEC, Serial (NS16550), I2C, SPI, etc.

🔷 2. Boot Flow of T2080 from Power-On to OS

Here’s the step-by-step boot flow for a typical T2080 system running VxWorks:

🔄 Boot Sequence:

1. Power-On Reset (POR)

Power and clock stabilize

Reset config words read from pins/EEPROM



2. Primary Boot Loader (PBL)

Loads RCW (Reset Configuration Word)

Initializes basic hardware (DDR, I/O mux, etc.)



3. Boot ROM (e.g., NOR Flash or SPI Flash)

Fetches and executes romInit.s

Sets up stack, memory map, exception vectors



4. VxWorks Boot Loader (bootApp)

Optional, loads kernel image from TFTP, disk, or flash

Initializes Ethernet, console, FS



5. vxWorks Kernel Starts

BSP runs sysHwInit() and usrRoot()

Initializes networking, shell, apps



6. User Applications

Starts mission apps (e.g., sensor processing, UI rendering)

🔷 3. T2080 VPX Board Design Checklist

Here is a practical checklist for hardware designers building a VPX or custom embedded board using the T2080.

🛠️ Hardware Design:

Category	Checklist Item

Power	Provide clean power rails: VDD_CORE, VDD_IO, VDD_PLL
	Use PMIC or discrete power rails
Clocking	Provide 100 MHz for core PLL
	Spread-spectrum clock for EMI reduction
DDR3 Interface	Length-match differential pairs
	Use ECC-capable DRAM for avionics
Ethernet	Route 10G SGMII or XAUI lanes carefully
	Include EEPROM for PHY config
PCIe	Impedance match PCIe lanes (85 ohm diff)
	Support Gen2 (5.0 GT/s) or fallback
Serial RapidIO (optional)	Only if used — treat as high-speed serial
Flash Boot Memory	NOR/NAND/SPI (4MB+ for secure boot image)
Debug	Include secure JTAG header, optionally locked
Thermals	Include heatsink or conduction-cooling baseplate



---

🔐 Security Design (Optional):

Feature	Tip

Secure Boot	Use RCW to enforce hash checking of boot image
JTAG Lock	Implement tamper prevention via Fuse or OTP config
Crypto Keys	Use internal SEC5.4 engine for secure data transport

🔷 5. Software Strategy: AMP System with VxWorks and Linux

Using T2080's AMP (Asymmetric Multi Processing) capability:

Core(s)	OS	Function

Core 0,1	VxWorks	Real-time mission control, I/O
Core 2	Linux	Graphics and UI management
Core 3	Linux or Crypto OS	IPsec, VPN, security gateway


✅ Bootloader (U-Boot or custom) loads multiple OS images and assigns cores via device tree or RCW.
