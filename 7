🔧 1. BSP Structure for T2080 (VxWorks 7 or later)

A VxWorks BSP for T2080 includes several components and directories tailored to the processor and board (often a VPX SBC):

📂 Typical Directory Tree

vxworks7/
├── bsp/
│   ├── t2080vpx/
│   │   ├── Makefile
│   │   ├── config.h         <-- System-wide config flags
│   │   ├── config.c         <-- Init code, MMU, CPU setup
│   │   ├── sysHwInit.c      <-- Board-level hardware init
│   │   ├── sysLib.c         <-- Device driver glue
│   │   ├── romInit.s        <-- Reset vector, startup
│   │   ├── sysPhysMem.c     <-- Physical memory map
│   │   ├── sysLbc.c, sysDdr.c, etc.
│   │   ├── vxbus/           <-- VxBus device tree integration
│   │   └── deviceTree/
│   │       └── t2080vpx.dts <-- Device tree source

📌 Key Customization Points

config.h: Enables AMP, PCIe, SRIO, Ethernet, etc.

romInit.s: Sets up early memory, low-level CPU config.

sysHwInit.c: Sets up clocks, DDR, bridges, flash, UARTs.

deviceTree: Describes CPU cores, memory regions, I/O for AMP.


> For AMP, multiple device trees may be used (e.g., one per OS partition).

🪜 2. Step-by-Step Boot Flow on T2080

🔁 Typical Boot Sequence:

1. Power-On Reset
    ↓
2. Boot Source (NOR, SPI, NAND, SD)
    ↓
3. Reset Configuration Word (RCW)
    - Sets up PLLs, I/O controllers, SerDes
    ↓
4. Boot Loader (e.g., U-Boot or VxWorks BootROM)
    ↓
5. Loads Device Tree, Kernel/Binary
    ↓
6. Launches VxWorks/AMP Image(s)

🧠 VxWorks BootROM (romInit.s)

Configures memory

Initializes MMU (BSP-defined regions)

Sets stack

Jumps to usrInit() to start the kernel


> For AMP, BootROM typically loads separate images to specific DDR regions and wakes cores accordingly.

📐 3. 3U VPX Board Design Checklist (Using T2080)

⚙️ Core Design Points

Element	Designer Notes

CPU	T2080 BGA, 4-core, 8-thread
Memory	2x DDR3L (ECC), up to 8–16 GB
Flash	NOR/SPI for boot; NAND/SD optional
PCIe	x4 routed to VPX backplane (Gen2/3)
10G/1G Ethernet	1x 10G + 2x 1G to rear IO or mezzanine
SRIO v2.1	Connected to FPGAs or VPX fabric
USB / UART / GPIO	For debug or payload
VITA 46.11	IPMI/MGT for VPX board health
Power	5V or 12V input, ~10–15W envelope
Cooling	Conduction-cooled or air-cooled wedge-lock design
Security	Secure boot, TrustZone, encrypted JTAG
Backplane Compatibility	VITA 46.x / 48.x compliant, FACE-aligned design


✅ You may also route PCIe/SRIO to an FPGA for expansion, video, or mission logic.

🧠 4. AMP Setup: Windows + VxWorks on T2080

🛠️ Target Use Case:

Run VxWorks 7 (real-time) on one set of cores

Run Windows 10 IoT Enterprise (non-real-time) on another core set

Use shared memory or PCIe RP/EP for communication


> T2080 doesn't natively support Windows. But here's how you simulate or partition the system:




---

🔀 Real AMP Partitioning on T2080 (VxWorks + Linux / RTOS):

Core	OS	Usage

0,1	VxWorks	Real-time mission code
2,3	Linux	GUI / network / Windows-like UI


> You could use Linux with Wine or QEMU guest VM to emulate Windows functionality if needed.




---

🧱 AMP Setup Process

1. Configure BSP for AMP:

AMP_CPU_NUM flags in config.h

Define memory regions per OS in sysPhysMem.c



2. Split Memory Map:

E.g., VxWorks: 0x0000_0000 – 0x3FFF_FFFF

Linux:     0x4000_0000 – 0x7FFF_FFFF



3. Device Tree Editing:

Define /cpus, /memory, and I/O nodes for each OS region



4. Boot Loader (U-Boot or VxWorks BootROM):

Load VxWorks image at 0x1000000, launch on Core 0

Load Linux or QEMU-Windows image at 0x4000000, launch on Core 2



5. Inter-core Communication:

Use RPMsg or custom shared memory driver

Use a mailbox, interrupt, or PCIe endpoint link





---

🔄 Alternate (Simulated Windows + VxWorks AMP) via QEMU on Linux

If you insist on Windows binary support and T2080's architecture doesn't natively run it, consider this:

Core	OS/VM	Description

0,1	VxWorks	Real-time operations
2	Linux Host	Run QEMU
VM	Windows 10	GUI, simulation, logs


> Practical for control + UI split, but Windows is not native to T2080's PowerPC ISA.
