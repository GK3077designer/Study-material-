A Single Board Computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, integrating all the components required for a functional computer system:

Processor (CPU)

Memory (RAM)

Storage

Input/output interfaces (I/O)

Power management

‚úÖ Why SBCs Are Important in Embedded & Avionics Systems

Single Board Computers are widely used in embedded systems, industrial control, aerospace/defense, and IoT, where size, weight, power (SWaP), and ruggedness are critical.

In avionics, SBCs are the computing heart of systems like:

Mission computers

Display processors

Flight control units

Data recorders
