üß© What is VPX?

VPX (VITA 46) is a modern embedded system standard that replaces older VME and cPCI with high-speed serial interconnects (PCIe, Ethernet, Serial RapidIO, etc.). It is widely used in:

Mission computers

Radar/Signal processing

EW systems

C4ISR

Avionics subsystems

üìè What Does "3U" Mean?

In VPX, "3U" refers to the physical size of the board:

Size	Dimensions	Used In

3U	~100mm x 160mm	Compact systems (UAVs, embedded avionics)
6U	~233mm x 160mm	More I/O, used in large systems (EW, radar)

üß† 3U VPX Card Architecture Overview

A typical 3U VPX card includes the following components:

üî∏1. Processing Core

High-performance multi-core CPU, GPU, or FPGA

Examples:

Intel Xeon-D

NXP Layerscape

Xilinx Ultrascale+ MPSoC

NVIDIA Jetson



üî∏2. High-Speed Fabric Interconnects

Backplane serial fabrics, typically:

PCIe Gen3/Gen4

10/40 GbE

Serial RapidIO

InfiniBand


Uses MultiGig RT2 connectors (VITA 46)


üî∏3. Memory Subsystem

High-speed DDR4/DDR5 with ECC

Flash storage for boot and OS

NVMe SSDs for local storage (optional)


üî∏4. I/O Interfaces

Routed via VPX backplane and P1/P2 connectors

Common interfaces:

USB, RS-232/422

MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429

DisplayPort, HDMI

GPIO

SATA/NVMe



üî∏5. Ruggedization Features

Conduction or Air-cooled (VITA 48 standards)

Withstand vibration, shock, extreme temps

Typically meets MIL-STD-810, DO-160, etc.


üî∏6. RTOS and Software

Runs real-time OS like:

VxWorks

INTEGRITY

Linux

RTEMS


Middleware: DDS, OpenGL/SC, FACE-compliant software

üß± VPX Card Pinout and Slot Layout

Backplane Connectors:

P0 (Utility): Power, system management (VITA 46.11)

P1/P2: PCIe, Ethernet, SATA, custom I/O

P3‚ÄìP6 (optional): Additional lanes for fat-pipes or optical (VITA 66/67)


Data Pipes:

Ultra-Thin Pipe: Single-lane (x1)

Thin Pipe: x4 PCIe or x4 SRIO

Fat Pipe: x8 lanes

Double Fat Pipe: x16 lanes (high-performance GPU/FPGA boards)
