ARINC Protocols in FPGA: Tutorial from Basics to Advanced

Introduction: ARINC (Aeronautical Radio, Inc.) standards are industry-defined avionics specifications that ensure reliable, standardized communication between aircraft systems. Founded in 1929 (later part of Collins Aerospace), ARINC’s suite of protocols (e.g. ARINC 429, 629, 664, 653) defines data buses and software interfaces for commercial and military aircraft. These standards enable interoperability and safety across diverse avionics equipment. In modern fly-by-wire aircraft, ARINC protocols link sensors, flight-control computers, displays, and other Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), replacing bulky analog wiring with digital data networks for robust, fault-tolerant operation. This tutorial covers each major ARINC protocol from first principles through detailed specifications and FPGA implementation, including examples of real avionics use.

ARINC 429 (Mark 33 DITS): Serial Data Bus

Beginner Overview: ARINC 429 is the legacy digital data bus used on most commercial transport aircraft. It is a uni-directional, point-to-point bus: one transmitter (Tx) drives up to 20 receivers (Rx) over a twisted-pair differential link. Data is sent as fixed 32-bit words containing a label (8 bits) and data (19 bits) plus parity. Typical applications include sending air data (altitude, speed), navigation updates, and status from sensors/computers (e.g. Air Data Computer, Flight Director) to displays and autopilot. ARINC 429 words transmit at low speed (12.5 kb/s) or high speed (100 kb/s). In practice, each Tx channel is dedicated to a single direction (backplane) and there is no bus arbitration – devices simply sample all words on the wire.

Figure: Simplified ARINC-429 bus topology – a single transmitter sends data to multiple receivers over a differential twisted-pair. The transmitter continuously outputs 32-bit words or null states, and receivers self-clock to decode the data.

Advanced Details: ARINC 429’s 32-bit word is structured as **Label (8 bits) + SDI (2 bits) + Data (19 bits) + SSM (2 bits) + Parity (1 bit)**. The 8-bit label identifies the data type (e.g. barometric altitude, selected heading) and is transmitted MSB first. The 19-bit data field carries the numeric value (binary or BCD), often right-justified. Two “Source/Dest ID” bits (SDI) allow one Tx to mark which of up to 4 receivers should process the word; if unused, they can augment data. Two “Sign/Status” bits (SSM) indicate validity or sign of the data. Finally an odd parity bit ensures each word has one ‘1’ in total. Words are transmitted in bipolar Return-to-Zero (RZ) encoding: each bit is driven to +10V (logic ‘1’) or –10V (logic ‘0’) and then returns to 0V. The transmitter alternates between sending valid words and an idle “NULL” state (0 V). Typical update rates are set by major/minor frame scheduling (e.g. each label may repeat every 25–100 ms). Error handling is minimal: parity checks at the receiver detect single-bit errors, and a ‘Not Computed’ or ‘No Computed Data’ (SSM=11 or 00) flags invalid values. ARINC 429’s simplicity (fixed-length frames, no arbitration) makes it very robust and easy to certify.

Figure: ARINC-429 32-bit word format. Each word contains an 8-bit Label (type ID), 2-bit SDI (destination ID), 19-bit Data, 2-bit SSM (status), and 1-bit Parity. Note: labels themselves are transmitted MSB-first, whereas multi-bit data fields are often LSB-first within the word framing..

FPGA Implementation (ARINC 429): On an FPGA, an ARINC 429 interface typically consists of two sides: a Transmit unit and a Receive unit. The Tx unit includes a 32-bit shift register and a baud-rate generator. For example, a 2 MHz FPGA clock divided by 2 yields a 1 MHz bit clock for 1 MHz/10 (100 kb/s high-speed) data. Verilog TX logic loads a 32-bit word into a register, computes odd parity, and then serially outputs each bit at the ARINC bit rate. An RZ encoder drives an external ±10V line-driver IC. Pseudocode Verilog snippet:

reg [31:0] word_reg;
reg       sending;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (start_tx) begin
    word_reg <= {parity, SSM, data, SDI, label};  // prepare 32-bit word
    sending <= 1;
  end else if (sending) begin
    tx_line <= (word_reg[31] ? +10V_line : -10V_line); // drive bit
    word_reg <= word_reg << 1; // shift to next bit
    if (&word_reg) sending <= 0; // done after 32 bits
  end
end

The Receive unit uses an input comparator and clock recovery: it oversamples the bus to detect RZ edges, reassembles bits into a 32-bit buffer, checks parity, and presents valid words. Many FPGA designs use a serial-in/parallel-out shift register and edge-detect logic. Several IP cores exist: for instance, OpenCores hosts a free ARINC-429 core that provides synthesizable Tx/Rx (12.5 kb/s or 100 kb/s, 2 MHz clock). Vendors like Microsemi/Actel also offer soft IP cores. In practice, an FPGA-based ARINC-429 interface connects the TTL logic to an external ARINC line transceiver (which handles the ±10V drive and isolation). Simulation and testing involve generating test vectors of 32-bit words, verifying parity, and injecting errors (e.g. flip bits to test parity detection). During FPGA verification, designers monitor the bus waveform (RZ pulses) on an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to confirm timing. ARINC-429 is relatively easy to implement in HDL due to its simple framing and fixed timing.

Use Cases: ARINC 429 is pervasive in commercial transport avionics. For example, Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737/747 use ARINC 429 to connect sensors (pitot-static, inertial), flight management computers, and cockpit displays. Typical channels might send altitude, airspeed, navigation info, fuel levels, etc. Even newer aircraft retain ARINC 429 for many “instrument-level” data streams. Its simplicity and long history make it familiar to aerospace engineers.

ARINC 629: Multi-Source Data Bus

Beginner Overview: ARINC 629 is a high-speed multi-transmitter data bus introduced in the early 1990s to overcome ARINC 429’s limits. Unlike 429’s single-Tx design, ARINC 629 allows all devices (up to 128 terminals) to share one common bus. Each terminal can both send and receive messages, enabling a fully-connected “publish/subscribe” architecture. ARINC 629 runs at up to 2 Mb/s, far faster than ARINC 429, and was used on aircraft like Boeing 777 and Airbus A330/A340. The bus uses inductive couplers on the wire to connect each terminal (for isolation and easy removal). Communication is strictly scheduled: each terminal has predefined time slots (a decentralized TDMA scheme) to transmit data, so collisions are avoided by design. Common use cases included networked systems integration in wide-body jets (e.g. sharing flight control, navigation, engine data) where ARINC 429’s point-to-point links would be too cumbersome.

Advanced Details: ARINC 629 messages consist of blocks of 32-bit words (similar to 429) but differ in framing and access control. Each terminal may send up to 31 32-bit words in one message (a “word string”) and can transmit up to 256 words total per command sequence. A message frame typically includes a preamble/sync pattern, a label word (defining the data type), the data words, and parity. Unlike ARINC 429, ARINC 629 does not define fixed label positions; terminals insert labels at runtime. Timing is key: each station has a reserved transmit start time within the major frame, defined by its bit-time. All clocks in the network are self-generated (no central clock). ARINC 629 uses a token-based arbitration at the bit-level: if two terminals happen to transmit simultaneously, built-in priority rules and the strict slotting ensure resolution. The electrical interface is bipolar differential, like 429, but at higher speed. Error detection includes both parity bits and optional CRC on blocks. Redundancy (e.g. dual parallel buses) can be used for fault tolerance, with terminals often having Hot Standby configurations. Overall, ARINC 629 provides a deterministic, time-triggered bus: since each station’s slot is known, designers can guarantee delivery latencies. However, implementing ARINC 629 hardware is complex: one must build a bit-level timing generator, slot arbiter, and loop coupler interface.

FPGA Implementation (ARINC 629): Implementing ARINC 629 on FPGA typically involves these blocks: an Interface Controller with a programmable slot timer, transmit FIFO, receive buffer, and an inductive or transformer coupler interface. The transmitter needs a precise bit clock at 2 MHz (for 2 Mb/s, since 32 bits × 1 MHz = ~32 µs per word). A scheduler logic enables the Tx only during the station’s allotted slots. The receiver logic continuously monitors the bus: it uses an oversampling PLL to recover bit timing, looks for the preamble (sync), then shifts in words. A block diagram might show an FPGA with SERDES or LVDS I/O, connected to a coupler, plus logic state machines for bit-level arbitration. FPGA vendors offer ARINC-629 IP: for example, VPC (Vectronix) provides a 629 soft-core.

FPGA code snippet (conceptual): A Verilog fragment might handle the transmitter’s scheduled burst:

reg [5:0] slot_count;  // slot index
reg tx_enable;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (reset) slot_count <= 0;
  else if (bit_timer == 0) begin
    slot_count <= slot_count + 1;
    // check if this slot is ours:
    tx_enable <= (slot_count == my_slot) ? 1 : 0;
  end
  if (tx_enable) begin
    // load and shift out next word from TX FIFO at 2 MHz bit clock
    tx_line <= next_bit;  // encode +5V/-5V for 1/0
  end
end

Simulation of ARINC-629 interfaces involves emulating multiple terminals and verifying that data appears in the correct slots without overlap. Test setups may use vector generators or loopback of the coupler.

Use Cases: ARINC 629 was deployed on late-1990s wide-body jets. For instance, Boeing designed it for the 777, and Airbus used it on the A330/A340 families. It linked a large number of units (up to 128) such as flight control computers, inertial reference units, and multifunction displays. In defense, variants of 629-inspired buses (e.g. Boeing’s “Enhanced Data bus”) appeared. However, ARINC-629 hardware was proprietary (the Boeing DATAC bus), so its adoption beyond these models was limited. In FPGA-based avionics equipment for 777/787 or A330/A340 simulators, ARINC-629 controllers handle test/data collection, often via companion ASICs or FPGA IP cores.

ARINC 653: Avionics Partitioning (Software Standard)

Overview: ARINC 653 is not a data bus but a software API standard for safety-critical avionics RTOS partitioning. It specifies how to build and schedule software partitions (applications) in an Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture. Each ARINC 653 “partition” has its own memory space and time slot on a cyclic schedule. The standard defines the APEX API (Application Executive) for creating processes, inter-partition communication channels (ports), and handling errors. In effect, ARINC-653 ensures that one faulty application cannot corrupt another (spatial isolation) and that each application gets CPU time (temporal scheduling).

Advanced ARINC-653 details include: a “major time frame” divided into minor frames (slots) assigned to partitions; each partition’s WCET and period are defined statically. The standard also covers health monitoring and partition reboot. ARINC-653.1/2/3/4 are parts: Part 1 defines mandatory services (partition mgmt, process mgmt), Part 2 adds optional services (file I/O, etc.), Part 3 is conformity tests, and Part 4 (recent) addresses dynamic reconfiguration (e.g. swapping FPGA modules). Typical major frame lengths range from 1–60 seconds. In practice, ARINC-653 is used with DO-178C safety certification on DO-254 FPGA designs with embedded processors or softcores.

FPGA Implementation (ARINC 653): Implementing ARINC-653 on FPGA means implementing or porting an ARINC-653-compliant OS or hypervisor on FPGA-based processing elements (e.g. MicroBlaze, Nios II, or ARM cores in SoCs). Some FPGA platforms use dual-core setups with a hypervisor that enforces ARINC-653 rules. For example, one could run a partition scheduler on an FPGA softcore, mapping each ARINC partition to a memory-protected MPU region. Commercial ARINC-653 RTOS (e.g. LynxOS-178, XtratuM, DDC-I’s Deos) can run on FPGA CPUs. There are also specialized ARINC-653 Part 4 references (e.g. DDC-I’s announcement) about certifying FPGA reconfiguration.

Use Cases: ARINC 653 is used in Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) across modern aircraft. On platforms like Airbus A380/A350 and Boeing 787, safety-critical software (flight control, engine control) runs on ARINC-653 RTOS on multi-core hosts. FPGAs with softcore CPUs have been demonstrated with ARINC-653 hypervisors to implement mixed-criticality partitions. In testbeds and simulators, ARINC-653 enables running multiple simulated avionic applications on a single FPGA board, mirroring real ARINC-653 behavior.

ARINC 664 (AFDX): Avionics Ethernet

Beginner Overview: ARINC 664 Part 7 is known as AFDX (Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet). It applies Ethernet networking to avionics with deterministic behavior. AFDX uses COTS Ethernet PHYs and switches (IEEE 802.3) but adds real-time guarantees. It is full-duplex, switched, and supports dual-redundant links. Each end system transmits on Virtual Links (VLs) – logical one-way flows with a fixed bandwidth. Each VL has a static Bandwidth Allocation Gap (BAG) that limits its packet rate, ensuring guaranteed delivery windows. AFDX runs at 100 Mb/s (as per original spec) though modern variants also allow 1 GbE interfaces. Used on aircraft like Airbus A380, A350, A400M, ATR‑42/72, and Boeing 787, AFDX carries critical data (flight control, navigation, radar). Its advantages over older buses include high throughput, reduced wiring (star topology with switches), and QoS features.

Advanced Details: The ARINC 664 Part 7 (AFDX) network consists of End Systems (LRUs) connected to one or more Ethernet switches in a dual-redundant star. Each End System encapsulates ARINC-653 partitions’ data into UDP frames. A “virtual link” is defined by destination MAC, IP, port, and the BAG period (e.g. 2 ms). A traffic-policing regulator in each End System enforces that each VL sends at most one frame per BAG interval. Frames include an ARINC-664 sequence number (SN) for reliability. Ethernet switches for AFDX are non-blocking and perform filtering/policing: they ensure that VL traffic stays within bandwidth and forward each VL to its subscriber(s) only. The network is fully deterministic: since each VL’s bandwidth is pre-allocated and collisions don’t occur in switched Ethernet, worst-case latency bounds can be computed. ARINC-664 also specifies maximum frame sizes (up to 1518 bytes standard, but typical ARINC frames carry ~100 bytes of payload).

FPGA Implementation (ARINC 664): On FPGA, AFDX uses Ethernet MAC and UDP/IP stacks. Many FPGAs have built-in 10/100/1000 Ethernet MACs (e.g. Xilinx Tri-Mode MAC) or soft IP cores. The FPGA must implement:

Ethernet MAC/PHY interface: Often using a Gigabit Ethernet PHY chip (e.g. 1000BASE-T).

Traffic shaper: A hardware token bucket to enforce the VL’s BAG. This might be integrated in the end-system IP core.

UDP/IP engine: To encapsulate data from partitions into UDP/IPv4 (or IPv6) packets; many use a lightweight IP core.

Switching logic (for Avionics Switch): In an AFDX switch FPGA, implement multiple MAC ports with bridging tables, VLAN filtering, and per-VL traffic policing (often done via on-FPGA TCAM and counters).
For example, iWAVE Systems provides an ARINC-664/AFDX end-system IP core that supports multiple VLs and EAP (Ethernet Avionics Profile) compliance. Verilog snippets might configure DMA transfers of packet data to/from host memory, or instantiate a MAC core.


Example Code Snippet: Using Xilinx Vivado IP might look like:

// Instantiate tri-mode Ethernet MAC
axi_ethernet #(.C_M_AXI_DATA_WIDTH(32)) eth_mac (
  .ref_clk(clk125), .resetn(rstn), .rgmii_txd(mgmt_data_out), 
  .rgmii_tx_ctl(mgmt_tx_en), .rgmii_rxd(mgmt_data_in), 
  .rgmii_rx_ctl(mgmt_rx_dv), .dma_tx(eth_dma_tx), .dma_rx(eth_dma_rx)
);
// Traffic shaping (conceptual): ensure TX_en only when token bucket allows

Simulation/Testing: A common approach is to use PC-based AFDX switch emulators or test generators. Packet captures verify the BAG timing and sequence numbers. FPGAs can be looped back or connected to test switches that monitor VLs. Tools like OPNET or specialized AFDX testers model worst-case latencies.

Use Cases: ARINC 664/AFDX is used on new-generation airliners. Airbus introduced it on the A380 (and later A350, A400M). Boeing adopted it (with fiber links) on the 787 Dreamliner. Heliborne platforms (AgustaWestland AW101/169) and regional jets (ATR‑72, Bombardier Global 6000) also use AFDX for integrating flight controls and sensors. In these systems, Ethernet switches (often triple-redundant fabrics) and ARINC-653 end-systems exchange flight-critical data deterministically. FPGA implementations appear in ARINC-664 switches and network interface cards (for test equipment), where high-speed FPGA logic processes thousands of VLs.

Other ARINC Protocols (Brief)

ARINC 825 (Avionics CAN): A profile of CAN bus for avionics, supporting up to 1 Mb/s raw (typically ~250–500 kb/s for robustness). It is used where simplicity and low latency suffice (e.g. non-critical control messages). On FPGA, ARINC-825 is implemented via standard CAN IP cores (with deterministic ARINC timing rules).

ARINC 818 (Digital Video): A high-speed (up to several Gbit/s) video bus standard. FPGA designs for ARINC-818 use SERDES lanes and often proprietary IP (e.g. AxiStreamer) for video streaming. It’s beyond the scope here but important for HUDs/Cameras.

Others: ARINC 615 (file transfer over 429/1553 for flight deck uploads), ARINC 717/573 (older FDR buses), ARINC 708 (air data). These use point-to-point serial and are less common in new designs.

Summary

ARINC standards provide the glue that holds avionics systems together. ARINC 429 is a simple one-way bus for sensor data; ARINC 629 is a high-speed multi-node bus; ARINC 664/AFDX leverages Ethernet for real-time switched networking; and ARINC 653 defines the software architecture for safe, time-partitioned systems. Each has distinct timing, framing, and implementation characteristics (e.g. ARINC-429 uses bipolar RZ at 100 kb/s, while AFDX uses 100 Mb Ethernet with virtual link shaping).

In FPGA-based avionics, engineers implement ARINC protocols by combining hardware and logic blocks: shift registers and comparators for 429/629; Ethernet MACs and UDP cores for AFDX; and CPU/hypervisor designs for ARINC-653. Reference designs and IP cores (some open-source) accelerate development. Testing relies on known avionics data patterns and hardware-in-the-loop setups, often using integrated test cards (e.g. UEI boards for ARINC-429/664).

In sum, mastery of ARINC protocols—understanding their data formats, timing (bit rates, slotting or BAG intervals), and encoding rules—is essential for avionics FPGA design.
